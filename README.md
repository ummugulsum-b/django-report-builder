## Development quick start

This package uses Django in Docker and Angular CLI for development purposes.

1. Start docker `docker-compose up`
2. Migrate and create an admin user `docker-compose run --rm web ./manage.py migrate`
3. Start the Angular CLI server. Ensure Node is installed. `cd js`, `yarn`, `yarn start`
4. Django runs on port 8000 by default. Go to localhost:8000/admin and log in.
5. Angular runs on port 4200. Now that you are logged in, go to localhost:4200
